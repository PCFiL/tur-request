#--[ Path and other settings ]----------------------------------#
#                                                               #
# glroot     = The root of glftpd. Since this script works from #
#              both inside glftpd and shell, we need this here. #
#                                                               #
# requests   = Where to create the requested dirs. This is      #
#              your request dir on site, seen chrooted.         #
#              ( meaning, dont add /glftpd ).                   #
#                                                               #
# gllog      = Path to glftpd.log for bot announcing, chrooted. #
#              Set this to "" or put a # infront to disable.    #
#                                                               #
# log        = If you want it to log requests and reqfills, set #
#              this to some file. "" or # = Disable.            #
#                                                               #
# reqfile    = File to store requests in. You can put this in   #
#              your request dir if you like. If you want it     #
#              to be displayed every time someone enters the    #
#              request directory, add it to 'show_diz' in       #
#              glftpd.conf                                      #
#              Make sure this file exists and has perms so      #
#              anyone can write to it.                          #
#                                                               #
# tuls       = Path to the tuls binary. This is a seperate      #
#              package available on www.grandis.nu.             #
#              Put the tuls binary in /glftpd/bin and set this  #
#              to /bin/tuls as its seen from glroot above.      #
#                                                               #
#              You do NOT need this binary if                   #
#              enable_rewardsystem=FALSE (further down)         #
#                                                               #
# passchk    = Path to passchk binary. Its included in          #
#              this package so compile it, put it in            #
#              /glftpd/bin and enter the path, seen from glroot #
#              here                                             #
#              This is used for authentication when users send  #
#              their username and password from irc.            #
#                                                               #
#              Note that if you dont want users to send their   #
#              real password, you can have a look at            #
#              tur-passchk, available from www.grandis.nu       #
#                                                               #
# passchk_ok = What does your passchk binary return if the      #
#              password matches? Its usually MATCH, or if you   #
#              use the one that comes with glftpd 2+, its: 1    #
#              ( tur-passchk returns MATCH ).                   #
#              You need to check this yourself. Just run it     #
#              from shell to see what it says.                  #    
#                                                               #
# passwd     = Path to your passwd file for glftpd.             #
#              Also seen from glroot above.                     #
#                                                               #
# filled_dir = If you want to have your filled requests in a    #
#              seperate directory, enter its name here. This    #
#              dir must exist within the requests directory, so #
#              remember to create it.                           #
#                                                               #
#              Leaving this option unset ("") will leave the    #
#              filled releases in the same dir as the requests  #
#              (default).                                       #
#                                                               #
# tmp        = Temporary dir to store some little stuff.        #
#              Seen chrooted ( from glroot above ).             #
#              Note that /glftpd/tmp does NOT exist by default  #
#              so create it and chmod it to 777.                #
#                                                               #
# datebin    = Specify which date binary to use. If you leave   #
#              it at "" it will just use 'date' and hope its in #
#              your path.                                       #
#              FBSD users will want to download sh-utils. It    #
#              will install a binary called gdate which you     #
#              must specify here.                               #
#              By default, FBSD's date binary is not GNU        #
#              compatible, which this script requires.          #
#              It needs to support the -d function.             #
#              Seen chrooted ( from glroot above ).             #
#                                                               #
#              Since its used from both glftpd and shell, it    #
#              needs to be in both /bin and /glftpd/bin.        #
#                                                               #
# allowspace = TRUE/FALSE. Allow spaces in requests?            #
#                                                               #
# replacewith= If allowspace is set to FALSE, you may set this  #
#              to a single character. It will replace all       #
#              spaces with this char. If this is set to '', it  #
#              will use the definable text (below) to tell the  #
#              user not to use spaces. Do NOT use '~' or '^'    #
#                                                               #
# badchars   = Chars that are not allowed to be in a request.   #
#              The '/' char is hardcoded. Dont touch this if    #
#              you are not familar with the format. Its a       #
#              standard egrep line.                             #
#                                                               #
# AUTH_SYSTEM= TRUE/FALSE.                                      #
#              With this set to FALSE, anyone can request and   #
#              you control this in the tcl file. You should use #
#              the tur-request.no_auth.tcl tcl on your bot.     #
#              Also, some functions will not work when this is  #
#              false, like the reward system.                   #
#              When set to FALSE, tur-request will work as it   #
#              did prior to version 2.12.                       #
#                                                               #
#              With it set to TRUE, users will need to          #
#              authenticate with their usernames / password in  #
#              a private message to the bot. Use the            #
#              tur-request.auth.tcl on your bot if so.          #
#              If set to TRUE, the following settings controls  #
#              its behaviour:                                   #
#                                                               #

# file_date=   When checking when the dir was created, I use an #
#              external binary. Using 'ls --full-time' is not   #
#              working 100% on all linux distros, so this is    #
#              the best way to do it. Its compiled on linux and #
#              also comes with the source. Anyway, this is the  #
#              full path to the binary. It is ONLY needed if    #
#              removefdays is enabled above.                    #
#              Default is: "/glftpd/bin/file_date"              #
#                                                               #

#              Test it by running it with a file or dir as      #
#              argument ( /glftpd/bin/file_date /root )         #
#                                                               #
# mustinclude= This is what the dirs must include to be deleted #
#              by the removefdays function above. By default,   #
#              its '^FILLED\-' because the requesthead below,   #
#              is also FILLED- by default.                      #
#              So, it will only delete dirs starting with       #
#              FILLED- when they are (removefdays) old.         #
#                                                               #
#              This uses standard expressions, like using ^ to  #
#              force only match on dirs starting with the word. #
#              Remember that any non alpha chars needs to be    #
#              marked with a backslash (\) first, like the      #
#              example. Do not use spaces.                      #
#              It is case sensitive.                            #

#              Setting this to "" or putting a # infront of it  #
#              causes it to check ALL dirs and files.           #
#              This is for those not using FILLED- to mark      #
#              filled requests. If set so, make sure to set the #
#              setting below so nothing else important is       #
#              deleted. It will check both dirs and files.      #
#                                                               #
# exclude=     For removefdays only as well. This is what NOT   #
#              to delete. If you set mustinclude above, this    #
#              isnt really needed I guess. However, the default #
#              is '\.requests|^REQ\-' so that it does not del   #
#              the .requests file and no dirs starting          #
#              with REQ-                                        #
#              If mustinclude above is disabled then make SURE  #
#              you specify ANYTHING you want to keep in the     #
#              requests dir here, as removefdays checks both    #
#              files and dirs. It is case sensitive.            #
#                                                               #
#              ^REQ\- is specified because the removefdays      #
#              should not remove those dirs. The removedays     #
#              handles those.                                   #

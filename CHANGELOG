#-[ Changelog for Tur-Request ]---------------------------------#
If upgrading more then one version at a time, follow the
"To upgrade from ..." for each version down.
#---------------------------------------------------------------#

2.15.1: Fix: If msgsdir was not set in the config, it could not
             get the info on who made a request. This is now fixed.

 To upgrade from 2.15:

 * Replace tur-request.sh

#---------------------------------------------------------------#

2.15  : Add: New setting in config:
             do_not_create_dir_until_filled="TRUE/FALSE"

             When set to TRUE, the request dir is not added upon
             request. Its added on reqfilled instead. See the config
             for full explanation.

 To upgrade from 2.14:

 * Replace tur-request.sh

 * Add to config, below filledhead= :
   do_not_create_dir_until_filled="FALSE"
   (or TRUE if you want to use this.. recomended FALSE)

#---------------------------------------------------------------#

2.14  : Chg: New setting in the config: AUTH_SYSTEM=TRUE/FALSE.
             This controls how Tur-Request works. With it set to
             TRUE, it will require glftpd authentication as added
             in version 2.12.
             When set to FALSE, it will works as it did prior to
             2.12. Note that when set to FALSE, some functions will
             not work, such as the rewardsystem and limiting number
             of requests per user.

        Chg: There are now two tcl files. One is used if AUTH_SYSTEM=TRUE
             (tur-request.auth.tcl) and the other if its set to FALSE
             (tur-request.no_auth.tcl).

        Chg: Changed the config file a little to reflect which settings are
             useless if AUTH_SYSTEM=FALSE.

 To upgrade from 2.13:

 * Replace tur-request.sh

 * Remove tur-request.tcl from your bots config dir and replace it with
   EITHER tur-request.auth.tcl OR tur-request.no_auth.tcl.
   Load your selected tcl file in the bots config (removing tur-request.tcl from it)
   and then RESTART the bot. Do not just .rehash it as it will not unload tur-request.tcl
   unless you restart it.

 * Its recomended that you replace tur-request.conf. If you do not want to, have a look
   at the format and edit yours in a similar way.


#---------------------------------------------------------------#

 2.13  : Fix: Will now automatically strip ^ from the list of commands.
              Users with ^ in their nick from irc could not use !reqfilled <number>.
              Thanks ^ArT^ for the testing.

 To upgrade from 2.12:

 * Replace tur-request.sh

#---------------------------------------------------------------#

 2.12  : Fix: When reqwiping/reqdelling/reqfilling using -hide, the requests list
              will no longer be shown, if set to be shown on those actions.

         Fix: When reqwiping and the dir was not found, it would give the announce as
              if you had reqfilled. It will now be correct.

         Chg: BIG change. All commands, except reqfilling, now needs glftpd
              authentication. That means that you use:
              /msg botnick !request <username> <password> <request> (-hide) (-for:username)
              /msg botnick !reqdel <username> <password> <reqname/number> (-hide)
              /msg botnick !reqwipe <username> <password> <reqname/number> (-hide)

              The public !request, !reqdel and !reqwipe commands, when used in open
              channel, no longer works. Instead, it informs the user of the new system.
              This is done in tur-request.tcl so replace that one as well.

              No commands are locked to ops only in the tcl anymore. Its all handled by
              the script itself instead.

              All commands that go through OK will go the channel by logging it to
              glftpd.log (same way as from inside glftpd). Error messages, like, wrong pass
              etc etc, goes to the user in a private msg.

              A note on this. Admins that dont want their users to send their password
              through irc can instead have a look at tur-passchk at www.grandis.nu
              It works perfectly fine to specify that script as passchk binary in the config
              so the users can send a code instead of the real password. More on that in the
              tur-passchk package itself.

              All this is so we can keep track of WHO did WHAT by going by the glftpd username
              instead of irc nick. This enables us to...

         Add: Added functions so you can limit the amount of requests a user can do. As for now
              you can only exclude this totally by flag or entering the username in the .conf.
              This will be changed in the future to specific amount of requests per user/group
              etc.

         Add: Since reqwipe is no longer locked to ops only, we have functions in the config
              to decide who can use reqwipe. Reqdel is also open for everyone, but its function
              has not changed, in that you can only reqdel your own requests. Admins use reqwipe.

         Add: As for reqwipe, we also have settings to control WHO can request.

         Add: Added a new config setting; date_format_in_reqfile=NEW/OLD
              When set to OLD, the date format in the requestfile is unchanged and best suit
              the US I guess.. with set to NEW, its better suited for Europe (YYYY-MM-DD HH:MM)
              Current requests are not affected. No need to edit date manually in reqfile.

         Add: Added a new argument when requesting; -reward:<MB>
              This is a reward, in MB, which the reqfillers will be awarded, above the credits
              given the user from uploading files (unless giving credits in your requests dir is
              disabled).

              The reward will be split up to the people who uploaded the request based
              on number of files.
              If the request was 100 files and there were two uploaders, one upping 40 files
              and the second 60 files, user 1 gets 40% of the reward and user two gets 60%.       

              If one, or all, of the fillers have RATIO 0, they get nothing of course.

              Who does the actual !reqfill does not matter.

              The credits will be taken from the requester when doing the actual
              request, unless its a user or flag that matches the config settings 
              for "free -reward:".

              In case the request is !reqdelled (can only be done by the requester or a siteop)
              then the credits will be given back to the requester.
              Same thing if its automatically removed for being too old (crontab job).

              The type of files that are counted for the reward can be decided by you as well.

 To upgrade from 2.11:

 * Replace tur-request.sh

 * Replace tur-request.tcl and RESTART your bot.

 * Go through the default config for what to move into your own.
   Its probably easier to start from scratch unless you made a lot
   of custom stuff in the announce part.

 * If you plan on using the rewardsystem, download the tuls package
   from www.grandis.nu and put it in /glftpd/bin.

 2.11  : Add: Added seperate announces in tur-request.conf for 
              reqfilled, reqdel and reqwipe.                   

         Add: Added another option to tur-request.conf.
              DONT_SHOW_STATUSANNOUNCE_FROM_GL=TRUE/FALSE.
              Set to true to NOT display the STATUSANNOUNCE when 
              doing stuff from inside glftpd. This is if you use
              pzs-ng which has a common header used. If so, you
              dont want the STATUSANNOUNCE added as well.
 
         Add: Added instructions for bot output in the README for
              newer versions of pzs-ng.

         Fix: Another fix for when reqfilling/reqdel/reqwipe by
              name. Hope it holds this time then.. (IT DID!)

         Fix: If requestshead wasnt set, it still tried to check
              that the requestdir was not empty when reqfilling.
              Since the dir didnt exist, thats kinda pointless.
              Wont do that anymore.
                                                               
 To upgrade from 2.10:                                         
                                                               
 * Replace tur-request.sh                                      

 * In tur-request.conf, below STATUSANNOUNCE=, add:
   DONT_SHOW_STATUSANNOUNCE_FROM_GL=FALSE
                                                               
 * Change your current FILLANNOUNCE. %ACTION% is no longer   
   a valid cookie so just replace it with 'reqfilled' such as: 
   FILLANNOUNCE="%BOLD%[Request] -%BOLD% %WHO% reqfilled %BOLD%%WHAT% - %RELEASE%%BOLD%. Good work!"
                                                               
 * Add a similar one just below for FILLANNOUNCE_DEL, such as:            
   FILLANNOUNCE_DEL="%BOLD%[Request] -%BOLD% %WHO% deleted %BOLD%%WHAT% - %RELEASE%%BOLD%."
                                                               
 * Add a similar one just below for FILLEDANNOUNCE_WIPE, such as:         
   FILLANNOUNCE_WIPE="%BOLD%[Request] -%BOLD% %WHO% wiped out %BOLD%%WHAT% - %RELEASE%%BOLD%."

 * Smile
                                                               
#---------------------------------------------------------------#
                                                               
 2.10  : Add: New option in config: filled_dir=""              
              This is a directory in your requests dir where   
              all the filled releases will be stored.          
              Simply enter the directory name, such as         
              filled_dir="_filled"                             
              Remember to create this dir and chmod it to 777. 
                                                               
              Leave at "" to not enable this feature.          
                                                               
         Fix: After editing the .requests file, it will try    
              to chmod it to 666. Should not be needed, but    
              some reported write errors to it, so...          
                                                               
              Remember to hide the .requests file using        
              hidden_files in glftpd.conf                      
                                                               
         Add: If it "didnt get any resonable action", it will  
              display the action it got in (). Woppido.        
                                                               
 To upgrade from 2.7 -> 2.9.1:                                 
                                                               
 * Replace tur-requests.sh.                                    
                                                               
 * Add to the config, below 'reqfile': filled_dir=""           
                                                               
 * If you want to use the filled_dir feature, create the dir   
   and chmod it to 777.                                        
                                                               
#---------------------------------------------------------------#
                                                               
 2.9.1 : Fix: Reqfilling by name looks like it could have      
              triggered the wrong request sometimes. This      
              means that when reqwiping, it could wipe some    
              other dir in the request dir.                    
                                                               
              Since nobody actually took the time to test and  
              report this to me, I'm gonna assume its all fine 
              now, lazy mofos.                                 
                                                               
#---------------------------------------------------------------#
                                                               
 2.9   : Add: You can now reqfill/reqdel/reqwipe using the     
              name of the request instead of the number. The   
              number way still works too, of course.           
                                                               
 To update from 2.8, just replace tur-request.sh               
                                                               
#---------------------------------------------------------------#
                                                               
 2.8   : Fix: 'tur-request.sh checkold' got funky when delling 
              more then one release at a time. Especially if   
              showonauto=TRUE in the config. It would delete   
              one, announce the rest, delete another (wrong    
              one), announce the rest, and so on.              
                                                               
              Rewrote this part totally.                       
              If showonauto=TRUE, it will list the remaining   
              requests only once its finished deleting.        
                                                               
              Big thanks to BoGuS as usual.                    
                                                               
 To update from 2.7, just replace tur-request.sh               
                                                               
#---------------------------------------------------------------#
                                                               
 2.7   : Add: When requesting, it will now show the number the 
              request gets too. Most helpful if someone fills  
              it straite away.                                 
                                                               
         Add: Two new options in the config:                   
              showonfill=TRUE/FALSE                            
              showonrequest=TRUE/FALSE                         
              These, when set, will show current requests when 
              either requesting and/or reqfill, reqdel &       
              reqwipe                                          
                                                               
         Add: The reqdel command will now only work if the     
              user that requested it initially matches the     
              username thats trying to reqdel it.              
              In other words, you can only reqdel your own     
              requests.                                        
              This means that we can now allow 'reqdel' for    
              everyone.                                        
                                                               
              This was added since you can not (since 2.6)     
              reqfill an empty release to remove it.           
                                                               
              Administrators should instead use 'reqwipe' to   
              clear out releases.                              
                                                               
 To upgrade from 2.6, replace tur-request.sh and add those two 
 new config settings below cc= in tur-request.conf             
                                                               
 Replace the tcl or change the bind on 'reqdel' from o to -    
                                                               
 Change the permissions in glftpd.conf for 'site reqdel' from

 2.6   : Add: When reqfilling, it will now check if the reqdir 
              is empty. If so it wont allow a reqfill.         
                                                               
              Two new announces for this one. One for IRC and  
              one if you're in glftpd.

 2.5   : Fix: You can now have [, ] and | in your nick and it  
              will still work from irc. What it will do is     
              strip those chars away so your name will be      
              displayed without them.                          
                                                               
         Fix: It will now try and chmod the messages files it  
              creates to 666 to not cause permission denied on 
              the files.                                       
                                                               
         Add: Added option max_requests= so you can decide the 
              maximum number of current requests.              
                                                               
         Add: Added option TOOMANYREQUESTS= to announce if too 
              many requests have been made already.

 2.4.4 : Fix: 'checkold' text wrote to screen instead of to    
              the log if that was on.                          
                                                               
         Fix? Might have fixed the tr error that some users    
              were having. Guess I'll know soon enough.        
                                                               
  Upgrade from 2.4.4: Replace tur-request.sh                   
                                                               
#---------------------------------------------------------------#
 2.4.3 : Fix: When it deleted a filled request due to it being 
              older then defined days, it would echo to screen 
              instead of writing to the logfile - Fixed.       
              Also uses the STATUSANNOUNCE as a header for     
              that output now.                                 
              ( the 'tur-request.sh checkold' function ).      
                                                               
         Fix: When doing !request from irc without args, it    
              said "Usage: site request ..." when it should    
              say "Usage: !request ..." - Fixed.               
              Thanks LPC.                                      
                                                               
         Chg: The datebin function in the config was not       
              described anywhere. It is now in the config but  
              no need to replace your current config really.   
                                                               
  Upgrade from 2.4.2: Replace tur-request.sh                   
                                                               
#---------------------------------------------------------------#
 2.4.2 : Fix: STATUSANNOUNCE is no longer used as a header for 
              'site requests' from glftpd.                     
                                                               
#---------------------------------------------------------------#
 2.4.1 : Fix: Sigh! 'tur-request.sh status auto' outputted the 
              text to shell instead of to irc. Thought I had   
              tested that but apparently not.                  
                                                               
#---------------------------------------------------------------#
 2.4   : Chg: It no longer announces on irc if you do, for     
              instance 'site reqfilled' from glftpd. Leftover  
              from old versions that kicked in for some reason.
                                                               
         Fix: %BOLD% and %ULINE% are always stripped if        
              executed from inside glftpd so no more happy     
              faces and whatever else that popped up.          
                                                               
         Fix: STATUSANNOUNCE wasnt actually used as a header   
              when checking stats.                             
                                                               
         I plan on totally splitting irc and glftpd announces  
         but for now I'm tired of scripting so deal with it =) 
                                                               
  Upgrade from 2.3: Replace tur-request.sh                     
                                                               
#---------------------------------------------------------------#
 2.3   : Add: Added option badchars. Previously, the chars     
              "\*|\[|\]|\{|\]|\^|\~" would not be allowed. It  
              still is, but now you can change them. '/' is    
              still hardcoded though.                          
                                                               
         Add: Added option usersdir which points to the users  
              dir (duh). Its used when sending messages if you 
              have msgsdir defined, to verify that the user    
              really exists so it dosnt fill up with "dead"    
              messages.                                        
                                                               
      Change: Change how it announces for most of the irc      
              stuff. It no longer uses the triggers REQUEST    
              REQFILLED or REQSTATUS in favor of using one     
              trigger: TURGEN. This is the same as some of my  
              other scripts.                                   
                                                               
              In light of this, the announcesystem was         
              rewritten to use one procedure for all announces 
              to easy for those without dZSbot.tcl.            
              The new 'proc_output()' is at the bottom of the  
              included config.                                 
                                                               
              This means that if you request from irc, all     
              irc announces go to the chan the command was     
              initiated in.                                    
                                                               
              4 new settings in the announce part of the .conf 
              since it stopped using the old triggers.         
              When someone requests something:                 
              REQANNOUNCE=                                     
              When someone requests something, using -for:     
              REQANNOUNCE2=                                    
              When someone fills a request:                    
              FILLANNOUNCE=                                    
              Header for static status messages:               
              STATUSANNOUNCE=                                  
                                                               
              When running from irc, it no longer writes to    
              glftpd.log like it does from inside glftpd.      
              Instead, its just echoed so the output from irc  
              always shows up in the channel it was executed   
              in.                                              
                                                               
      Change: CHANGELOG split from README.                     
                                                               
      Change: Missed one or two wc -L. Fixed that for fbsd     
              functionality.                                   
              Rewrote a few sections while I was at it.        
                                                               
      Change: tur-request.tcl was changed a bit. You need this 
              on instead now if you want !requests to work.    
                                                               
  Upgrade from 2.2: Replace tur-request.sh                     
                    Replace tur-request.tcl                    
                     .restart the bot                          
                                                               
                    Check the default config file. You need 6  
                    new settings (badchars, usersdir,          
                    REQANNOUNCE, REQANNOUNCE2, FILLANNOUNCE &  
                    STATUSANNOUNCE) as well as the entire      
                    proc_output() section.                     
                                                               
                    In dZSbot.tcl:                             
                    Remove triggers REQUEST, REQFILLED and     
                    REQSTATUS. See README for how to add       
                    TURGEN instead, unless you already have it 
                    in your dZSbot.tcl.                        
                                                               
#---------------------------------------------------------------#
 2.2   : Add: Added ability to send a message to the user      
              doing the request when its filled.               
              If -for: was used then the message will be sent  
              to whoever was specified.                        
                                                               
              2 new options in the config for this:            
              msgsdir=/ftp-data/msgs                           
              cc=TRUE                                          
                                                               
              First is just the path, relative to your glroot  
              which holds the msgs dir.                        
              cc= if set to TRUE and the requested used -for:  
              should a message go to the requester as well?    
              For example, if I, as turranius, would request   
              something -for:Hujer, the reqfilled message will 
              always go to Hujer. But if cc is TRUE, a message 
              will ALSO go to turranius, telling me my request 
              for Hujer was filled by..                        
                                                               
              Setting msgsdir="" disables this function.       
                                                               
         Fix: Just some fixes to make it work on fbsd.         
              Apart from the non visable fixes, I also added   
              an option to the config.                         
              datebin=                                         
              Here you can specify which date binary to use.   
              Leaving it empty ("") is prefered as it will     
              just run 'date' from path. Should work for all   
              linux users. fbsd users however, must download   
              the sh-utils pack and specify gdate, which comes 
              with it, here.                                   
                                                               
              Note. Try NOT to specify full path to gdate or   
              whatever you set here. Using /glftpd/bin/gdate   
              will work fine from shell, but not from inside   
              glftpd due to chroot. Just put gdate in your     
              path somewhere and also copy it to /glftpd/bin.  
              Then just specify datebin="gdate"                
                                                               
         Fix: 'site request' made a request for 'request'. ops 
              Now shows a quick help instead.                  
                                                               
                                                               
#---------------------------------------------------------------#
 2.1.1 : Fix: Option -hide and -for: did not work when         
              starting an argument with it. I rewrote how it   
              checks for -hide and -for: and how it detects    
              whats the releasename and whats not.             
                                                               
  Update from 2.1: Replace tur-request.sh                      
                                                               
#---------------------------------------------------------------#
 2.1   : NEW: Totally rewritten. Nah, just kidding.            
              Added options to delete filled requests when     
              running 'tur-request.sh checkold'. Make SURE to  
              read the config file for how to use these ones.  
              You need a new binary thats included if you plan 
              to use it. If not, you have to disable it.       
                                                               
     Updated: To update from 2.0, you need to copy the new     
              file_date binary or compile the source.          
              Replace tur-request.sh too.                      
                                                               
              There are help text in the config for the        
              new settings, so probably easier to copy your    
              current settings into the new one. Just dont     
              remove any of the NEW settings in it =)          
              The new ones are (with default settings):        
                                                               
              removefdays=30                                   
              file_date="/glftpd/bin/file_date"                
              mustinclude='^FILLED\-'                          
              exclude='\.requests|^REQ\-'                      
                                                               
                                                               
#---------------------------------------------------------------#
 2.0   : NEW: Totally rewritten from scratch. Old one got      
              messy through the different versions and hard to 
              keep track of. This should ease further updates. 
              Probably full of bugs too. hehe.                 
              Bot configuration is still the same so no need   
              to anything to dZSbot.tcl if you had it working  
              before.                                          
                                                               
              If you crontabbed tur-request.sh status auto,    
              thats the same as before as well.                
                                                               
              This README was split out of tur-requests.sh     
                                                               
         Add: Changed how you reqfill, reqdel and reqwipe by   
              popular demand. It now uses a number infront of  
              the request in the requests file. Use this       
              number instead of the releasename for filling.   
                                                               
              This means that two settings are gone.           
              REQINFILE and REQINFILE2 are now hardcoded and   
              they have to be for me to parse the number,      
              dirname and when it was requested (see below).   
              The look of the .requests file is therefor no    
              longer configurable.                             
                                                               
              Maximum requests are 99. Can probably add more   
              but it will look like shit =)                    
                                                               
              Your old .requests file will have to be replaced 
                                                               
         Add: Since the above will probably crap out sometime  
              I added a new argument, 'fix' to rebuild the     
              .requests file with the correct numbers.         
              ( no reports of this yet, but cant hurt ).       
                                                               
         Add: Added another command, checkold. Running this    
              from shell will cause it to check if the request 
              was made later then 'removedays' ( a new setting 
              in the config ). If it is, it will automatically 
              do a reqdel on that release and announce it to   
              the chan. This function requires a crontab.      
              reqdel automatically dels the dir too, if empty. 
                                                               
         Add: Another setting in the config, showonauto.       
              If TRUE, it will display the remaining requests  
              on irc when it automatically deletes an old      
              request. With it to FALSE, it will only display  
              what it deleted.                                 
                                                               
         Add: Added a new variable in the config; replacewith  
              If you have allowspaces on FALSE, meaning you do 
              not allow people to request something with a     
              space in it, you can set this variable to a      
              single char and it will replace all spaces with  
              that char instead ( default is '_' )             
                                                               
         Add: New variable: log. This is another logfile,      
              seperate from glftpd.log, where it will log all  
              requests, fills, dels and wipes. Set to "" to    
              disable if you dont want it.                     
                                                               
         Add: When doing a 'reqdel' it will now delete the dir 
              too if there is one but ONLY if its empty.       
              If you wish to really wipe it, use reqwipe.      
              Ofcourse, already filled requests cant be wiped  
              or deleted since when filled it leaves this      
              scripts autohority =)                            
                                                               
         Add: -hide and -for:<username> can now be used at any 
              place in the request, so:                        
              site request -hide -for:turranius Release-GRP    
              is the same as                                   
              site request Release-GRP -for:turranius -hide    
                                                               
         Fix: Previously, when reqfilling and the FILLED- dir  
              already existed, it couldnt move it from REQ- to 
              FILLED-. Now it will simply add a 1 to the end   
              of the FILLED- dirname. If that exists, it will  
              add 2, etc etc.                                  
              It will make up to 20 tries before giving up and 
              just leave it.                                   
                                                               
         Fix: The argument tmp, to define the temporary dir    
              is by default /tmp, meaning /glftpd/tmp, but if  
              you ran it from irc, it didnt add the /glftpd    
              part. This could cause permission errors since   
              users would have to have full rights both to     
              /tmp as well as /glftpd/tmp.                     
                                                               
         Chg: A few of the custom texts have changed or been   
              removed, so best to replace current config.      
                                                               
      Update: To update, replace tur-request.sh and            
              tur-request.tcl ( in the bot. .rehash ).         
              Recomend you replace the config as well.         
              Check above for how to add it to glftpd.conf as  
               that changed for some of the commands.          
              Make sure the required binaries are in you       
               /glftpd/bin dir.                                
              Make a new .requests file.

 1.2.2 : Fix: Previously, it checked $FLAGS and $GROUP to find 
              out if it was running in glftpd or shell (irc).  
              This would fail if the user was in no group.     
              It now checks $FLAGS only.                       
                                                               
         Add: * [ ] { ] can not be used when requesting now.   
                                                               
         NOTE: Added to config is NONSTANDARDCHAR for what to  
               say when someone tries to use one of the above  
               chars. Add it to your previous one if upgrading.
                                                               
 1.2.1 : Fix: Crap fixes.                                      
                                                               
 1.2   : Fix: Modified instructions for reqdel above.          
                                                               
         Fix: If you had 3 requests, test1, test2 & test3 and  
              reqfilled 'test', it would remove them all from  
              the reqfile. Thanks LPC for reporting these.     
                                                               
         Add: Split up config to tur-request.conf              
                                                               
 1.1.1 : Fix: -hide didnt work when requesting.                
                                                               
 1.1   : Fix: The requested folder created had a space at the  
              end if you requested from glftpd.                
                                                               
         Fix: Requests starting with a - had problems.         
                                                               
         Fix: All checks for if a request exists or is filled  
              are now done in the file instead of checking if  
              the directory exists. This was flaky before.     
                                                               
         Add: You can now use -for:name to specify WHO the     
              request is for. REQINFILE2 text added.           
              ( site request -for:turranius More.Money-BP )    
              This will be displayed when checking requests.   
                                                               
         Add: Added another command. !reqdel. This will do a   
              normal reqfilled, but will not announce in main  
              chan. Replace the tcl for this to work from irc. 
              Basically just a reqfilled -hide                 
                                                               
         Add: Added another command. reqwipe. This will delete 
              the request from the reqfile AND wipe out the    
              folder if there is one, even if its not empty.   
              Replace the tcl as well if you want to use this. 
                                                               
 1.0   : Initial release.

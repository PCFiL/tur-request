# Copy tur-request.sh to /glftpd/bin. Make it executable (755). #
# Copy tur-request.conf to /glftpd/bin (same dir as .sh).       #

# Copy either tur-request.no_auth.tcl OR tur-request.auth.tcl   #
# to your bots scripts dir and load it in the bots config file. #
# Which one you choose depends on weither or not you want to    #
# use the authentication system in tur-request.                 #
# See the AUTH_SYSTEM setting in tur-request.conf for more info.#
# Edit your selected tcl and change any triggers if you dont    #
# like the default settings. Take note of my mad tcl skillz =)  #
#                                                               #
# If you use linux, copy file_date to your glftpd's bin dir.    #
# Otherwise, the source is included as well. This is ONLY for   #
# deleting old filled requests automatically. If you do not     #
# want to use this, set 'removefdays' to "" in the config.      #
# To compile the source: gcc -o file_date file_date.c           #

# Some of the binaries you need in /glftpd/bin are:             #
# basename, egrep, rmdir, cat, grep, touch, file_date, tr and   #
# some standard ones...                                         #
# If you are going to use the reward system, you need tuls as   #

# To make this mofo announce, We need to add some things.       #
# If you are using the old dark0n3s zipscript, the following    #
# goes to dZSbot.tcl.                                           #
# If you are using pzs-ng, it goes into dZSconf.tcl             #
# Note: If you are using a newer version of pzs-ng, you do not  #
#       need to do anything. TURGEN is already in the new       #
#       versions. Forgot exact build, but its in 1.0.1811 for   #
#       sure. Skip these instructions if so.                    #
#                                                               #
# Note: Depending on version, set msgtypes(DEFAULT) might not   #
#       exist in dZSconf.tcl. If so, find it in                 #
#       dZSbconf.defaults.tcl, copy it into dZSconf.tcl and     #
#       then add TURGEN to set msgtypes(DEFAULT) in dZSconf.tcl #
#                                                               #
# Check first that TURGEN is not already added. Its used for a  #
# few other scripts as well.                                    #
#                                                               #
# To 'set msgtypes(DEFAULT)', add TURGEN                        #
#                                                               #
# Add the following in the appropriate places:                  #
#--                                                           --#
# set chanlist(TURGEN) "#YourChan"
#
# set disable(TURGEN) 0
#
# set variables(TURGEN) "%msg"
#
# If you are using Dark0n3s dZSbot.tcl, this goes to dZSbot.tcl 
# as well:                                                      
# set announce(TURGEN)  "%msg"
#
# If, however, you are using pzs-ng (beta3 or higher), then
# this goes to your current theme file:
# announce.TURGEN = "%msg"

# To make it announce when using SiteStat5, simply replace      #
# TURGEN: with RAW: in all occurances of the .conf and the .sh  #
# Nothing more should be required.                              #

# To automatically display current requests when a user goes    #
# into your requests dir, edit glftpd.conf and put .requests    #
# in the show_diz field. Example:                               #
# show_diz file_id.diz .message .imdb .requests                 #

# If you want to hide the .requests file so that users can not  #
# edit or destroy it, edit glftpd.conf and put .requests on the #
# hidden_files field. Example:                                  #
# hidden_files .journal lost+found requests                     #
# Yes, it will still be displayed when entering the dir and     #
# users CAN still modify it, just not see it. Helps a bit.      #
# This is REALLY important to do incase you have the reward     #
# system enabled as it will be real easy to manually add a      #
# reward to the request otherwise.                              #
#                                                               #

# If you want to force users to use this script and NOT create  #
# dirs directly in the requests dir, add this to glftpd.conf:   #
# makedir /site/REQUESTS/*/ 1                                   #
# Change the path to suit your setup of course.                 #

# reqdel is used to delete your own requests. It will check if  #
# the username thats trying to reqdel is the same as the one    #
# doing the request.                                            #

# Siteops should instead use 'reqwipe' to delete other peoples  #
# requests.                                                     #
# This is needed because you can not reqfill an empty request   #
# and you might want to remove your request.                    #
#                                                               #

# If you run 'tur-request.sh status auto' it will check if      #
# there are any requests and if so, announce it to the channel. #
# If there are no requests, it will just quit. This is if you   #
# want a reminder in irc on all the requests from time to time. #
# You can just crontab it to do 'status auto' whenever you like.#
# So add this to crontab to announce all requests at 18:01.     #

# If you want it to automatically delete old requests, crontab  #
# the 'checkold' command whenever you like.                     #
# It will delete both unfilled requests and filled ones,        #

# When requesting, you can specify who the request is for.      #
# Simple add -for:username to the request and this will show in #
# the list when checking requests. Examples:                    #
# site request -for:turranius More.Money.BP                     #

# When requesting, you can add a reward for the filling of the  #
# request, if the rewardsystem is active. Use -reward:<mb>      #
# anywhere in the command.                                      #

# If you do not want it announce in the main channel when doing #
